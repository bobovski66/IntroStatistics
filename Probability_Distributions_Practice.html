  <!-- Problem 1: Continuous, area as probability -->
  <div class="problem">
    <h3>Problem 1: Waiting Time for the Campus Shuttle</h3>
    <p>
      Suppose the time $T$ (in minutes) a student waits for a particular campus shuttle is
      modeled by a continuous probability distribution with a smooth curve on the interval
      from 0 to 20 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curve is shaped so that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Very short waits (0–2 minutes) are rare.</li>
      <li>Moderate waits (5–10 minutes) are most common.</li>
      <li>Very long waits (15–20 minutes) are rare again.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Think of this as a “bump” centered between 5 and 10 minutes, with total area 1 under the curve.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        In words, what does $P(5 \le T \le 10)$ represent in this model?
      </li>
      <li>
        If the area under the curve from 5 to 10 minutes is 0.6, what is $P(5 \le T \le 10)$?
      </li>
      <li>
        If the area from 0 to 5 minutes is 0.2, what is $P(10 < T \le 20)$?
        Explain how you got your answer.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <details class="solution">
      <summary>Show solution</summary>

      <p><strong>(a) Interpreting $P(5 \le T \le 10)$</strong></p>
      <p>
        $P(5 \le T \le 10)$ is the probability that a randomly chosen student’s waiting time
        is between 5 and 10 minutes. In long-run language, it is the proportion of all shuttle
        waits that fall between 5 and 10 minutes.
      </p>

      <p><strong>(b) Area as probability</strong></p>
      <p>
        If the area under the curve from 5 to 10 is 0.6, then
        \[
          P(5 \le T \le 10) = 0.6.
        \]
        The curve is a density; probability is literally the area.
      </p>

      <p><strong>(c) Using the fact that total area is 1</strong></p>
      <p>
        Total area under the curve is 1. We are told:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Area from 0 to 5 minutes: 0.2,</li>
        <li>Area from 5 to 10 minutes: 0.6.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        So the area from 0 to 10 minutes is $0.2 + 0.6 = 0.8$.
        The area from 10 to 20 minutes must be
        \[
          1 - 0.8 = 0.2.
        \]
        That area is $P(10 < T \le 20)$.
      </p>
      <p>
        So $P(10 < T \le 20) = 0.2$.

  <!-- Problem 2: Mean & SD interpretation for continuous model -->
  <div class="problem">
    <h3>Problem 2: Daily Study Time as a Continuous Model</h3>
    <p>
      Suppose the number of hours a randomly chosen student studies in a day is modeled by
      a continuous distribution with mean $\mu = 2.0$ hours and standard deviation
      $\sigma = 0.5$ hours.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In words, what does the mean $\mu = 2.0$ hours tell you about this distribution?
      </li>
      <li>
        In words, what does the standard deviation $\sigma = 0.5$ hours tell you?
      </li>
      <li>
        Consider another course where daily study time has the same mean $\mu = 2.0$ hours
        but a larger standard deviation $\sigma = 1.0$ hours. How would the shape of that
        distribution compare to the first one?
      </li>
    </ol>

    <details class="solution">
      <summary>Show solution</summary>

      <p><strong>(a) Interpreting the mean</strong></p>
      <p>
        The mean $\mu = 2.0$ hours is the long-run average study time per day. If we look across
        all students over many days, their study times would balance at about 2 hours. It is the
        “center” of the distribution.
      </p>

      <p><strong>(b) Interpreting the standard deviation</strong></p>
      <p>
        The standard deviation $\sigma = 0.5$ hours measures how spread out the study times are
        around the mean. A standard deviation of 0.5 hour means that a typical daily study time
        is about half an hour away from the mean of 2 hours. Most students are between about
        1.5 and 2.5 hours.
      </p>

      <p><strong>(c) Same mean, larger standard deviation</strong></p>
      <p>
        If another course has the same mean $\mu = 2.0$ but a larger standard deviation
        $\sigma = 1.0$, then the second distribution is more spread out. The curves would be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          First course: narrow, taller bump around 2 hours (study times tightly clustered).
        </li>
        <li>
          Second course: wider, flatter bump around 2 hours (more variation; some students
          study much less or much more).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The center (mean) is the same, but the spread is different.
      </p>

  <!-- Problem 3: Discrete distribution and its mean -->
  <div class="problem">
    <h3>Problem 3: Number of Emails to a Club Advisor</h3>
    <p>
      Let $E$ be the number of emails a student club advisor receives from club members in a
      randomly chosen day. The advisor believes the long-run behavior is described by this
      discrete probability distribution:
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>$e$ (emails)</th>
        <th>0</th><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th><th>4</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>$P(E=e)$</th>
        <td>0.20</td><td>0.35</td><td>0.25</td><td>0.15</td><td>0.05</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <ol>
      <li>Check that this is a valid probability distribution.</li>
      <li>
        Find $P(E \ge 2)$ and interpret it in context.
      </li>
      <li>
        Compute the mean number of emails per day, $\mu_E = \sum e \cdot P(E=e)$.
      </li>
      <li>
        Interpret $\mu_E$ in a sentence that does not use symbols.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <details class="solution">
      <summary>Show solution</summary>

      <p><strong>(a) Valid distribution?</strong></p>
      <p>
        Add the probabilities:
        \[
          0.20 + 0.35 + 0.25 + 0.15 + 0.05 = 1.00.
        \]
        All probabilities are between 0 and 1 and the total is 1, so this is a valid
        probability distribution.
      </p>

      <p><strong>(b) $P(E \ge 2)$</strong></p>
      <p>
        \[
          P(E \ge 2) = P(E=2) + P(E=3) + P(E=4)
                     = 0.25 + 0.15 + 0.05
                     = 0.45.
        \]
        So on a randomly chosen day, there is a 45% chance that the advisor receives
        2 or more emails.
      </p>

      <p><strong>(c) Mean number of emails</strong></p>
      <p>
        \[
        \begin{aligned}
          \mu_E
            &= 0\cdot 0.20
             + 1\cdot 0.35
             + 2\cdot 0.25
             + 3\cdot 0.15
             + 4\cdot 0.05 \\
            &= 0
             + 0.35
             + 0.50
             + 0.45
             + 0.20 \\
            &= 1.50.
        \end{aligned}
        \]
      </p>

      <p><strong>(d) Interpretation of $\mu_E$</strong></p>
      <p>
        On average, the advisor receives about 1.5 emails per day from club members.
        In the long run, if we look at many days, the mean number of emails per day
        will be about 1.5.

  <!-- Problem 4: Empirical distribution and sampling variability -->
  <div class="problem">
    <h3>Problem 4: Sample vs Model for Exercise Days</h3>
    <p>
      A health center models the number of days per week that students get at least
      30 minutes of exercise with this discrete distribution for $D$:
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>$d$ (days/week)</th>
        <th>0</th><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th><th>4</th><th>5</th><th>6</th><th>7</th>

      <li>
        Suppose the population mean from the model above is $\mu_D = 3.2$ days.
        Compare $\bar d$ and $\mu_D$. Are they the same? Should we expect them to be?

      </table>
      <p>
        In decimals, that’s approximately:

        <li>$0$: $0.083$,</li>
        <li>$1$: $0.083$,</li>

        <li>$4$: $0.167$,</li>
        <li>$5$: $0.083$,</li>
        <li>$6$: $0.083$,</li>
        <li>$7$: $0$.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>(b) Sample mean</strong></p>
      <p>
        Add up the 12 values:
        \[
          3 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 5 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 2
          = 35.
        \]
        With $n = 12$ students:
        \[
          \bar d = \frac{35}{12} \approx 2.92 \text{ days}.
        \]
      </p>

      <p><strong>(c) Comparing $\bar d$ and $\mu_D$</strong></p>
      <p>
        We are told the population model has mean $\mu_D = 3.2$ days.
        Our sample mean is $\bar d \approx 2.92$ days. They are not exactly the same,
        but they are reasonably close.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do <em>not</em> expect $\bar d$ to equal $\mu_D$ exactly. Every random sample
        gives slightly different data and therefore a slightly different sample mean.
      </p>

      <p><strong>(d) Sampling variability</strong></p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sampling variability</strong> means that statistics like $\bar d$ will change
        from sample to sample, even when the population model is fixed. If we took another
        random sample of 12 students, we would almost surely get different exercise counts
        and a different sample mean.
      </p>
      <p>
        The population mean $\mu_D$ is a fixed (but often unknown) number. The sample mean
        $\bar d$ is random because it depends on which students happen to be in the sample.
