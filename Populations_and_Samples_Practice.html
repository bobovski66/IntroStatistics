    <h3>Problem 1: Campus Coffee Quality</h3>
    <p>
      The student government wants to know how many students think the coffee on campus is
      “good or excellent.” There are about 20,000 students enrolled at the college.
    </p>
    <p>
      They send a short online survey to a random sample of 1,000 students. Out of those, 640
      say the campus coffee is “good or excellent.”
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Identify the population and the sample in this situation.</li>
      <li>
        Define the population parameter of interest using a symbol and a clear sentence.
      </li>
      <li>
        Compute the sample statistic that estimates this parameter (use standard notation and
        give the numerical value).
      </li>
      <li>
        Write one sentence interpreting your sample statistic in context (no symbols).
      </li>
    </ol>

    <details class="solution">
      <summary>Show solution</summary>

      <p><strong>(a) Population and sample</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Population:</em> all 20,000 students enrolled at the college.</li>
        <li><em>Sample:</em> the 1,000 students who responded to the survey.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>(b) Population parameter</strong></p>
      <p>
        We care about the true proportion of all students who think the coffee is “good or excellent.”
        Let
        \[
          p = \text{proportion of all students who rate the coffee as good or excellent}.
        \]
        This $p$ is a population parameter (unknown).
      </p>

      <p><strong>(c) Sample statistic</strong></p>
      <p>
        In the sample, 640 out of 1,000 students gave that response. The sample proportion is
        \[
          \hat p = \frac{640}{1000} = 0.64.
        \]
        Here $\hat p$ is the statistic we use to estimate $p$.
      </p>

      <p><strong>(d) Interpretation in words</strong></p>
      <p>
        In our sample, 64% of the surveyed students said the campus coffee is good or excellent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later in the course, we will ask how close we think $\hat p = 0.64$ is to the true
        population proportion $p$.

    <h3>Problem 2: Weekly Reading Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      A reading group on campus challenges students to read more for fun. At the end of a week,
      the facilitator asks 6 randomly chosen participants how many hours they spent reading
      non-school books that week.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their answers (in hours) are:
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Student</th>
        <th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th><th>4</th><th>5</th><th>6</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Hours $x_i$</th>
        <td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <ol>
      <li>Compute the sample mean number of hours $\bar x$.</li>
      <li>
        Compute the deviations $x_i - \bar x$ and use them to compute the sample variance $s^2$
        and standard deviation $s$.
      </li>
      <li>
        Interpret $\bar x$ and $s$ in the context of this reading challenge.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <details class="solution">
      <summary>Show solution</summary>

      <p><strong>(a) Sample mean</strong></p>
      <p>
        The hours are $4,5,6,7,8,9$. The sample mean is
        \[
          \bar x = \frac{4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9}{6}
                  = \frac{39}{6}
                  = 6.5.
        \]
        So on average, these students read 6.5 hours that week.
      </p>

      <p><strong>(b) Sample variance and standard deviation</strong></p>
      <p>First compute the deviations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>$4 - 6.5 = -2.5$</li>
        <li>$5 - 6.5 = -1.5$</li>
        <li>$6 - 6.5 = -0.5$</li>
        <li>$7 - 6.5 = 0.5$</li>
        <li>$8 - 6.5 = 1.5$</li>
        <li>$9 - 6.5 = 2.5$</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Square them and add:</p>
      <p>
        \[
          (-2.5)^2 + (-1.5)^2 + (-0.5)^2 + (0.5)^2 + (1.5)^2 + (2.5)^2
          = 6.25 + 2.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 2.25 + 6.25 = 17.5.
        \]
      </p>
      <p>
        The sample variance is
        \[
          s^2 = \frac{17.5}{n-1}
               = \frac{17.5}{5}
               = 3.5.
        \]
        So the sample standard deviation is
        \[
          s = \sqrt{3.5} \approx 1.87.
        \]
      </p>

      <p><strong>(c) Interpretation</strong></p>
      <p>
        The average amount of reading for these 6 students was 6.5 hours that week. The
        standard deviation of about 1.9 hours means that a typical student's reading time
        is about 2 hours away from that average.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words, many students are between about $6.5 - 1.9 \approx 4.6$ and
        $6.5 + 1.9 \approx 8.4$ hours of reading.

  <!-- Problem 3: Parameter vs statistic with different stories -->
  <div class="problem">
    <h3>Problem 3: Parameter or Statistic?</h3>
    <p>
      For each statement below, decide whether the number described is a
      <strong>parameter</strong> or a <strong>statistic</strong>. Briefly explain your reasoning.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        “Every single seat in the college theater (all 150 seats) was checked, and 60% of the
        seats were found to have at least one broken armrest.”
      </li>
      <li>
        “A random sample of 80 students from the college found that their average commuting
        time was 39.2 minutes.”
      </li>
      <li>
        “Exactly 32% of all currently enrolled students at the college are taking at least one
        online class this term.”
      </li>
    </ol>

    <details class="solution">
      <summary>Show solution</summary>

      <p><strong>(1) Theater seat inspection</strong></p>
      <p>
        The statement says that <em>every single seat</em> in the theater (all 150) was checked,
        and 60% had a broken armrest. This describes the entire population of seats, not just a sample.
      </p>
      <p>
        $\Rightarrow$ This is a <strong>parameter</strong> (a population-level number).
      </p>

      <p><strong>(2) Average commute from a random sample</strong></p>
      <p>
        Here we only have a random sample of 80 students from the larger population of all students.
        The 39.2 minutes is computed from sample data and is meant to estimate the population mean
        commuting time.
      </p>
      <p>
        $\Rightarrow$ This is a <strong>statistic</strong> (a number from a sample).
      </p>

      <p><strong>(3) 32% of all students taking an online class</strong></p>
      <p>
        The phrasing “exactly 32% of all currently enrolled students” describes the entire
        population of students. In reality, we might not know this number perfectly, but if
        it were known, it would be population-level.
      </p>
      <p>
        $\Rightarrow$ This is a <strong>parameter</strong>.

    <h3>Problem 4: Time in the Campus Fitness Center</h3>
    <p>
      The director of the fitness center wants a snapshot of how much time students actually
      spend in the gym on a typical weekday.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a randomly selected Tuesday, staff record how many minutes each of 10 randomly chosen
      students spend inside the fitness center that day:
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Student</th>
        <th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th><th>4</th><th>5</th>
        <th>6</th><th>7</th><th>8</th><th>9</th><th>10</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Minutes $x_i$</th>
        <td>30</td><td>45</td><td>60</td><td>60</td><td>75</td>
        <td>90</td><td>120</td><td>120</td><td>150</td><td>180</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Compute the sample mean number of minutes $\bar x$ that these students spend in the gym.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using the fact that $\sum_{i=1}^{10} (x_i - \bar x)^2 = 21060$, compute the sample variance
        $s^2$ and standard deviation $s$.
      </li>
      <li>
        Interpret $\bar x$ and $s$ in the context of time spent in the fitness center.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <details class="solution">
      <summary>Show solution</summary>

      <p><strong>(a) Sample mean</strong></p>
      <p>
        The total number of minutes is
        \[
          30 + 45 + 60 + 60 + 75 + 90 + 120 + 120 + 150 + 180 = 930.
        \]
        With $n = 10$ students,
        \[
          \bar x = \frac{930}{10} = 93.
        \]
        So on average, these students spent 93 minutes in the fitness center that day.
      </p>

      <p><strong>(b) Sample variance and standard deviation</strong></p>
      <p>
        We are told that
        \[
          \sum_{i=1}^{10} (x_i - \bar x)^2 = 21060.
        \]
        The sample variance is
        \[
          s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{10} (x_i - \bar x)^2
              = \frac{21060}{10 - 1}
              = \frac{21060}{9}
              = 2340.
        \]
        So the standard deviation is
        \[
          s = \sqrt{2340} \approx 48.37.
        \]
        We might round this to $s \approx 48.4$ minutes.
      </p>

      <p><strong>(c) Interpretation</strong></p>
      <p>
        The mean $\bar x = 93$ minutes means that, on that Tuesday, the typical student in this
        sample spent about an hour and a half in the fitness center.
      </p>
      <p>
        The standard deviation $s \approx 48.4$ minutes tells us that there is a lot of variation:
        a typical student's time is about 48 minutes away from the mean. Some students stayed
        much less than 93 minutes, and some stayed much longer.
